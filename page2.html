<h2 class="text-success">Preventive Measures</h2>
<p>
    1.Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others.<br/>
    2.Quarantine,covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.<br/>
    3.The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public places.<br/>
    4.Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.

<h3 class="text-warning">Signs and Symptoms</h3>
    <p>
        1.Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all.
        <br/>2.Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.
<br/>3.Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.
<br/>4.Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.
<br/>5.Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.
<br/>6.Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations. A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.
<br/>7.Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.<br/>

    Complications
</h3>
<p>
    Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular  <br/>complications may
    include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.
</p>
<p>
    A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that "the risk for severe COVID-19 was 45% higher for people with type A blood than those with other blood types.
</p>
<p>
    Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury.<br/>
    Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome <br/>
    Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, <br/>
    which can be fatal.
</p>
<h3>Vaccine</h3>
<p>
    There is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.<br/>
    Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.<br/>
    Six vaccination strategies are being investigated. Four of these, as of early July 2020, are being tested in clinical trials.<br/>
    First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such inactive virus aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID‑19.<br/>
    . A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
